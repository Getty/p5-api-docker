=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generated from the C<ContainerSummary> definition of C<spec/v1.51.yaml>,
which the swagger leaves undescribed. C<paths:> says what it is: one entry
of the C<200> response to C<GET /containers/json> and the C<Containers>
field of the C<200> response to C<GET /system/df>.

=cut

docker id => Str;

=attr id

The ID of this container as a 128-bit (64-character) hexadecimal string (32
bytes).

=cut

docker names => [Str];

=attr names

The names associated with this container. Most containers have a single
name, but when using legacy "links", the container can have multiple names.

For historic reasons, names are prefixed with a forward-slash (C</>).

=cut

docker image => Str;

=attr image

The name or ID of the image used to create the container.

This field shows the image reference as was specified when creating the
container, which can be in its canonical form (e.g.,
C<docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest> or
C<docker.io/library/ubuntu@sha256:72297848456d5d37d1262630108ab308d3e9ec7ed1c3286a32fe09856619a782>),
short form (e.g., C<ubuntu:latest>)), or the ID(-prefix) of the image (e.g.,
C<72297848456d>).

The content of this field can be updated at runtime if the image used to
create the container is untagged, in which case the field is updated to
contain the the image ID (digest) it was resolved to in its canonical,
non-truncated form (e.g.,
C<sha256:72297848456d5d37d1262630108ab308d3e9ec7ed1c3286a32fe09856619a782>).

=cut

docker image_id => Str, wire => 'ImageID';

=attr image_id

The ID (digest) of the image that this container was created from.
Serialised as C<ImageID> -- spelled out, because deriving it from the Perl
name would produce C<ImageId>.

=cut

docker image_manifest_descriptor => 'OCIDescriptor', since => '1.51';

=attr image_manifest_descriptor

OCI descriptor of the platform-specific manifest of the image the container
was created from.

Note: Only available if the daemon provides a multi-platform image store.

This field is not populated in the C<GET /system/df> endpoint. See
L<API::Docker::Type::OCIDescriptor>.

=cut

docker command => Str;

=attr command

Command to run when starting the container.

=cut

docker created => Int;

=attr created

Date and time at which the container was created as a Unix timestamp (number
of seconds since EPOCH).

=cut

docker ports => [ 'Port' ];

=attr ports

Port-mappings for the container. See L<API::Docker::Type::Port>.

=cut

docker size_rw => Int;

=attr size_rw

The size of files that have been created or changed by this container.

This field is omitted by default, and only set when size is requested in the
API request.

=cut

docker size_root_fs => Int;

=attr size_root_fs

The total size of all files in the read-only layers from the image that the
container uses. These layers can be shared between containers.

This field is omitted by default, and only set when size is requested in the
API request.

=cut

docker labels => { Str, Str };

=attr labels

User-defined key/value metadata. B<The keys are the caller's data> and are
never translated.

=cut

docker state => Str,
  enum => [qw( created running paused restarting exited removing dead )];

=attr state

The state of this container. The swagger enumerates C<created>, C<running>,
C<paused>, C<restarting>, C<exited>, C<removing> and C<dead>.

=cut

docker status => Str;

=attr status

Additional human-readable status of this container (e.g. C<Exit 0>).

=cut

docker host_config => 'ContainerSummary::HostConfig';

=attr host_config

Summary of host-specific runtime information of the container. This is a
reduced set of information in the container's "HostConfig" as available in
the container "inspect" response. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ContainerSummary::HostConfig>.

=cut

docker network_settings => 'ContainerSummary::NetworkSettings';

=attr network_settings

Summary of the container's network settings. See
L<API::Docker::Type::ContainerSummary::NetworkSettings>.

=cut

docker mounts => [ 'MountPoint' ];

=attr mounts

List of mounts used by the container. See L<API::Docker::Type::MountPoint>.

=cut

1;
